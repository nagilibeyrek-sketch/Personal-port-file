            **Description:** This project was developed as the core requirement for the **SITE 1101 Personal Website assignment**[cite: 3]. It focused on applying fundamental HTML structure and CSS styling to create a static webpage[cite: 4]. The main goal was to practice semantic HTML elements, basic CSS layout, ensure **responsive design** which adapts the website for phones and tablets , and prepare the site for deployment via **GitHub Pages**. The repository shows **multiple commits** demonstrating the progress of development. The screenshot (**project1ss1.jpg**) displays the finished Home Page, including the profile photo, summary text, and the functional navigation bar[cite: 13, 19, 42].

        <p>
            **Description:** This project is the **optional** addition based on the **Hour of Code** activity[cite: 15]. The activity provided introductory experience in coding principles, focusing on fundamental block-based programming, such as sequencing, loops, and conditional logic. The screenshot (**project2ss2.jpg**) captures the final state of the coding exercise, demonstrating basic programming concepts applied to the assigned task. This project showcases my willingness to add **other projects** that I wish to include.
